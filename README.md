# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

In this project, I created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished entrepreneurs. I created routes to manage 'minions', brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to a busy schedule.

## How to Use

Its necessary to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application.
Once it has finished installing, you can run `node server.js` to begin the server. (Node.JS Required) You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. 

To see the application in its working state, simply open **index.html** in a web browser. You should use (at least version 60) or [Firefox](at least version 55).
